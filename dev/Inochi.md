    💥Meet Inochi

    What if your AI could eliminate the manual data entry bottleneck for one of Vietnam's fastest-growing consumer brands?

    Inochi (a member of DNP Corp)’s sale admins are manually entering orders from PDF files and images into the SO/Bravo system, leading to time loss and high risk of input errors.

    They’re inviting AI, OCR, and Retail-Tech startups to co-create breakthrough solutions to:

    Automate Order Processing: Implement an AI/OCR solution for seamless, direct data extraction from orders (PDFs/images) into the SO/Bravo system.

    Accelerate Business Operations: Eliminate the manual entry bottleneck to drastically reduce order processing time and streamline the retail supply chain.
    Ensure Data Accuracy: Mitigate input errors, ensure data consistency, and enable real-time synchronization across retail and e-commerce platforms.
    ```
Based on documents provided with an image demo on order recognition, make an proposal to customer.
